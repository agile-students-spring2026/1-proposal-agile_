# Soft Launch



### What and Why?



Soft Launch is a mobile web application that allows users to share ideas, thoughts, or drafts in a low-pressure way. Posts are created as temporary by default unless the user explicitly chooses to publish them later.



Many people hesitate to share ideas online because posting feels permanent and high-stakes. Soft Launch addresses this by making “unfinished” and “tentative” the default state of expression. The system reframes posting as a reversible action rather than a public commitment.



This is important because current social platforms optimize for polished, final output, discouraging experimentation, honesty, and early-stage thinking.



### For Whom?



The primary users are university students, designers, writers, and early-career professionals who frequently have ideas they want to externalize but not fully commit to publishing.



Initial users would include myself, my classmates, and peers who already share drafts and ideas informally through notes apps, private messages, or unfinished documents.



These users are real, accessible, and suitable for ongoing feedback throughout the semester.



### How?



From a user’s perspective, Soft Launch works as follows:



\- Users create short text posts or ideas

\- Posts are marked as “temporary” by default

\- Published posts become visible as finalized content



The focus is on reducing friction and anxiety around sharing, not on maximizing engagement or visibility.



### Scope



The project is intentionally limited in scope and well-suited for a semester-long group project. Core functionality includes basic post creation and simple publishing states.



The system avoids complex social features while still offering meaningful challenges in interaction design, state management, and user experience decisions.
